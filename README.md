# Continuous-Flash-Suppression-psychopy
Continuous Flashing Suppression task using Psychopy / version control

This is a BCFS task that mask Navon task. 

#CFS Mondrian
CFS mask will be generated through python code, and not image file because psychopy gui supports the framerate.
The mask will be in a form of a checkerboard, I assume is for the convenience of location identification.
Make sure you set the right borderline and intensitiy which I guess I will come back to update this- since I'm also confused as if for right now too.

You got this
